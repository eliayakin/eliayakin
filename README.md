# Elia Yakin

Hi I'm Elia, a data scientist with robust knowledge of theory and applicative experience in statistics, machine learning, causal inference, and econometrics. 

Most of my career I had been working on some of Israel's biggest social ane economic challenges. 

Latly I worked on developing Israel's best ML classifer of Haredi individuals in administrave data (govermental data). Here are some findings/tools that are based on the classifer:
 - 📔 [State of Haredi Society Annual Report 2023](https://machon.org.il/en/2023report-en/)
 - 📊 [Wohl's Data Center](https://data.machon.org.il/)
 - 🗞️ [Contrary to predictions: why the Haredi society will grow at a lower rate than expected (hebrew)](https://www.themarker.com/blogs/2024-06-03/ty-article/.premium/0000018f-dd15-dbdb-a59f-dd5de6390000)
 - 🗞️ [A new study reveals: double infant mortality among Haredi society (hebrew)](https://publichealth.doctorsonly.co.il/2024/04/314009/)

My Master's thesis on Israel's income gender gap used causal infrence analysis, and was published by Israel's ministry of finance was: 
- 🎓 [Parenthood and Gender Identity Impacts on Women Labor Force Outcomes in Israel](https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/article_13122021/he/Publishes_Articles_article_13122021.pdf) 
	And here are some reactions from the press (hebrew):
  - 🗞️ [TheMarker](https://www.themarker.com/career/.premium-1.10461190)
  - 🗞️ [Calcalist](https://www.calcalist.co.il/local_news/article/b10jii4cy)
  - 🗞️ [globs](https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001412554)

Additionaly, I love taking part in Israel's NLP comunity. Last year I participated in NLP IL's [kaggle competiotin](https://www.meetup.com/the-israeli-natural-language-processing-meetup/events/299728251/) to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an essay was written by a student or an LLM.
