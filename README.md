# Elia Yakin

Hi, I'm Elia. I'm a data scientist with robust knowledge of theory and applicative experience in statistics, machine learning, causal inference, and econometrics.
Throughout my career, I have been deeply involved in addressing some of Israel's most pressing social and economic challenges, making a significant impact in these areas.

Lately, I worked on developing Israel's best ML classifier of Haredi individuals in administrative data (governmental data). Here are some findings/tools that are based on the classifier:
 - 📔 [State of Haredi Society Annual Report 2023](https://machon.org.il/en/2023report-en/)
 - 📊 [Wohl's Data Center](https://data.machon.org.il/)
 - 🗞️ [Contrary to predictions: why the Haredi society will grow at a lower rate than expected (Hebrew)](https://www.themarker.com/blogs/2024-06-03/ty-article/.premium/0000018f-dd15-dbdb-a59f-dd5de6390000)
 - 🗞️ [A new study reveals double infant mortality among Haredi society (Hebrew)](https://publichealth.doctorsonly.co.il/2024/04/314009/)

My Master's thesis on Israel's income gender gap used causal inference analysis and was published by Israel's Ministry of Finance:
- 🎓 [Parenthood and Gender Identity Impacts on Women Labor Force Outcomes in Israel](https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/article_13122021/he/Publishes_Articles_article_13122021.pdf) 

And here are some reactions from the press (Hebrew):
  - 🗞️ [TheMarker](https://www.themarker.com/career/.premium-1.10461190)
  - 🗞️ [Calcalist](https://www.calcalist.co.il/local_news/article/b10jii4cy)
  - 🗞️ [Globs](https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001412554)

Additionally, I love taking part in Israel's NLP community. Last year (2023), I participated in NLP IL's [Kaggle competition](https://www.meetup.com/the-israeli-natural-language-processing-meetup/events/299728251/) to develop a machine learning model that accurately detects whether a student or an LLM wrote an essay:
- 📝 [Detect-LLM-Generated-Text](https://github.com/eliayakin/Detect-LLM-Generated-Text/tree/main) repository
- 🎤 [Slides](https://github.com/eliayakin/Detect-LLM-Generated-Text/blob/main/Textbusters%20-%20Detecting%20LLM-Generated%20Text.pdf) from a presantation I gave about our resuts in the NLP IL's meetup @ Amazon AWS
